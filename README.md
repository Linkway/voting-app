### What is this?
A very simple SPA voting system for conferences and other alike events. Simply click on one of 3 faces (happy, whatever, bad) to vote. This is mobile app and it is working on PhoneGap and Ionic. Using `HTML5 local storage` to save data.

Note: This is practically the same as [votiepi-app](https://github.com/Teodors/votiepi-app) except it works offline. Some time later it might get merged together. 

### Getting started
You will need [ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) installed and [node](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

 1. Run `npm install` to add dependencies. 
 2. Start gulp.lnk or run `gulp` to build CSS.
 2. Start app with `ionic run android`. If you have your phone plugged in with all drivers installed it will run on phone, else it will run on virtual machine.

Note: This is currently built for android, however, if you are on Mac run `ionic platform add ios` to run on iOS.
